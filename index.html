    <p id="bio">Bio:</p>

     My name is Florkenthia Medina Jolibois, what you need to know about me is that I’m a female from Boston, MA.This coming fall I will be a senior at BCLA (Boston Community Leadership Academy) and I super nervous yet excited. Boston is made up of many town, I live in Roslindale with my father, mother, younger brother and sister. Most of my friends live in Roslindale so I’ll mostly be with them or going around town and seeing what’s new. They’re so much to find in this small, friendly, and beautiful town. A public library, parks, restaurants, gyms, hair salon, nail salon, churches, and much more. Its summer time here in Boston and you’ll catch me at my pre-calculus program bright and early or at Girls Who Code at Akamai. Later in my day, I’ll be heading home to do some homework or watching some Netflix shows for the rest of the night.
